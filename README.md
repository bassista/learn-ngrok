# Learn `ngrok`

:cloud: Learn how to use **`ngrok`**
***`so that`*** you can share
a **Web App/Site** running on your "**localhost**"
with _anyone_ online!

## _Why?_

You are working on a Web App/Site on your **`localhost`**,
but it's "not yet ready" to be "deployed"

> _**Note**: once you are **ready**
to make your App/MVP "**official**",
you should consider using **Heroku**
as it does not require you to have your `localhost` running_
(_and it has good logging, "monitoring", "free tier", etc._). <br />
See:
[github.com/dwyl/**learn-heroku**](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-heroku)


## _What?_

The **_official_ description** on the website https://ngrok.com/product is:

> "_**`ngrok`** exposes **`local`** servers behind NATs and firewalls
to the **`public`** internet over secure tunnels_."

In _**plain** (beginner friendly) **English**_:

> _**`ngrok`** is a small piece of software
that lets you **run** a **web application** <br />
on your **`local` computer**
and (securely) **share it** with the world
on a **`public` address** ("URL")_.

## _Who?_

Anyone working on a Web App/Site
and needs a quick/easy way to _show_ or _test_ it <br >
without "_deploying_" it. e.g: you are _actively_ developing something
and deploying it to
[**Heroku**](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-heroku)
would be _too time consuming_.


## _When?_

### When _Should_ I Use **`ngrok`**?

A _great_ use-case is when you are in "**development mode**",
you have "**live-reloading**" enabled on your `locahost`
and you want any changes you make on your to be reflected
a _mobile_ device without having to ""

#### Developing Somewhere with "Strict" Firewall Rules?

Often you will be on a network with strict firewall rules
(_blocked TCP ports_)
that do not _allow_ you to share your app with your Mobile device!
e.g: in Coffee Shops, Libraries or "Corporate" Networks.

In these cases **`ngrok`** is a _great_ choice!

### When _Not_ to Use **`ngrok`**?

Avoid using **`ngrok`** when your app is being _actively_ used by people.
i.e: once your "MVP" is ready to be tested by "real users",
deploy it somewhere that is _not_ your `localhost`
e.g: [**Heroku**](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-heroku)


## _How?_

The official "getting started" guide is:

### Download & Install

First step on our quest is to download **`ngrok`** from the website:
https://ngrok.com/download

If you use a Mac computer (_and "homebrew"_) there's an **easy** way:





### Link Your **`ngrok`** "Account" to Your `locahost`



### Don't Have an App?

If you don't _already_ have an "App" to try/test **`ngrok`**,
you can simply "clone" this repository and try the "demo" App!

Copy-paste and run the following command:
